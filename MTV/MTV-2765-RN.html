				Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) 2.10 introduces the following features and enhancements:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
						In the MTV 2.10.0 UI, the Virtual Machines tab on the Plan Details page provides improved visibility of migration progress with a clearer page title label and a display of key events in logical order. You can also hide migration resources for a cleaner UI to assess the progress of your migration.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In MTV 2.10.0, you can optimize the asynchronous input/output (AIO) buffer configuration for the VMware disk development kit (VDDK) directly in the MTV UI. AIO buffer configuration is deactivated by default, but you can activate the feature and customize the configuration in YAML to improve storage I/O operations and reduce latency when working with VDDK. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2188">(MTV-2188)</a>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In MTV 2.10.0, you can create network maps directly in the MTV UI by adding a source and target network on the Create network map page instead of writing a YAML file.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In the MTV 2.10.0 UI, the Virtual Machines table in the Create migration plan wizard is enhanced to simplify navigation and provide a clearer view of selected VMs. With this update, you can bulk select VMs from the Virtual Machines table toolbar, switch between views of selected and unselected VMs, filter VMs by location, and manage columns. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3058">(MTV-3058)</a>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In MTV 2.10.0, you can find the status of cutover dates for warm migrations in the MTV UI. The cutover button is an icon in the UI for your migration plan that changes state when you set the date for a cutover so that you can easily identify if a cutover date is set.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In MTV 2.10.0, the Migrations section on the Plan Details page is relabelled as Migration history. The Migration history section contains tooltips to provide contextual information and make the section more useful for migration monitoring and troubleshooting.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						MTV 2.10.0 introduces a formatting feature for VMware system serial numbers. System administrators can use the formatting feature for consistent and error-free system serial numbers and easier system identification during migrations and configurations.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In MTV 2.10.0, you can customize the <code class="literal">nodeSelector</code> field and options for importer pods in the MTV UI, enhancing resource allocation, scheduling, and application performance. You can customize pod scheduling policies for importer pods to ensure that importer pods are scheduled on specific nodes for enhanced resource management and stability.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						MTV 2.10.0 supports the migration of Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) encrypted VMs by using Network Bound Disk Encryption (NBDE) with Clevis. With this update, you can migrate LUKS-encrypted VMs without rebooting the VMs to obtain a decryption key from the Clevis server. The Clevis server must be accessible from OpenShift. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3395">(MTV-3395)</a>
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In MTV 2.10.0, the <code class="literal">insecureSkipVerify</code> flag is set by default for ESXi hosts in the MTV UI, simplifying migrations in environments with self-signed certificates. With this setting, the migration process bypasses SSL certificate validation, reducing potential errors caused by certificates while maintaining security.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In MTV 2.10.0, you can configure VM scheduling preferences for migration plans in the MTV UI or the <code class="literal">Plan</code> Custom Resource (CR). You can add custom labels to migrated VMs, apply VM scheduling to specific nodes based on node labels, and implement affinity or anti-affinity rules for VMs against workloads or nodes. With this update, you can use the <code class="literal">TargetLabels</code>, <code class="literal">TargetNodeSelector</code>, and <code class="literal">TargetAffinity</code> fields to manage VM placement during migrations, improving resource utilization and operational compliance. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2768">(MTV-2768)</a>
					</li></ul></div></section><section class="section" id="rn-resolved-issues_release-notes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">1.2. Resolved issues</h2></div></div></div><p class="_abstract _abstract">
				Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV) 2.10 has the following resolved issues:
			</p><section class="section" id="resolved-issues-2-10-0_release-notes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title">1.2.1. Resolved issues 2.10.0</h3></div></div></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>User could not rename virtual machines to address naming conflicts before migration</strong></p><p>
						In previous versions of MTV, you could not rename virtual machines (VMs) from the source provider to address naming conflicts before the VMs were migrated to Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization. In this release of MTV, you can modify non-compliant VM names in the MTV UI during the migration process to address naming conflicts and ensure compatibility with OpenShift Virtualization naming conventions. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2919">(MTV-2919)</a>
					</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>User experience was interrupted when adding a new target project to a migration plan</strong></p><p>
						In previous versions of MTV, you had to close the Create migration plan wizard in the MTV UI to add a new target project to your migration plan. In this release of MTV, the option to create a new project as a target for VMs in your migration plan is available in the Target project dropdown list on the General page of the Create migration plan wizard.
					</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Warm migration failure before VM shutdown</strong></p><p>
						In previous versions of MTV, there was no inspection during MTV warm migration, which could lead to issues during guest conversion and potential migration failure after transferring disks. In this release of MTV, an inspection enables early detection of issues during guest conversion, and MTV warm migration fails before VM shutdown, allowing users to adjust VM settings or skip guest conversion.
					</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Importing OVAs required an NFS share</strong></p><p>
						In previous versions of MTV, you had to use an NFS share to import Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) to OpenShift Virtualization. In this release of MTV, you can import OVAs directly from local machines to OpenShift Virtualization by web browser and the MTV UI. With this update, you no longer need to use an NFS share to import OVAs. <a class="link" href="https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3371">(MTV-3371)</a>
					</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Raw Copy Mode applied compatibility mode to VMs with VirtIO drivers</strong></p><p>
						In previous versions of MTV, VM migration with Raw Copy Mode applied compatibility mode to use devices such as SATA bus, E1000E NICs, or USB, even for source VMs with pre-installed VirtIO drivers. In this release of MTV, you can set <code class="literal">useCompatibilityMode</code> to <code class="literal">true</code> or <code class="literal">false</code> in the Raw Copy Mode settings in the MTV UI to use either compatibility devices or pre-installed VirtIO devices.
					</p></div><div class="formalpara"><p class="title"><strong>Power state of source VMs was preserved post-migration</strong></p><p>
						In previous versions of MTV, the power state of a source VM was preserved post-migration. In this release of MTV, you can set the power state of a migrated VM to <code class="literal">off</code>, <code class="literal">running</code>, or <code class="literal">default</code>. For example, if you are migrating a VM that is running in the source environment, you can ensure that the VM is powered off post-migration to preserve dependencies between VMs. With this update, you can set the power state for the target VM in the MTV UI or by using the <code class="literal">powerState</code> field in the <code class="literal">spec.vms</code> section of the <code class="literal">Plan</code> Custom Resource (CR). The <code class="literal">default</code> setting preserves the power state of the source VM.
